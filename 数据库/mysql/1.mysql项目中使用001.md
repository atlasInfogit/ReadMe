#### 1.mysql设置索引

```mysql
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD INDEX (a);
```

#### 2.关联查询

```mysql
select concat(a,b) a , c b, concat(a1,c1) c from
(SELECT A.A,A.B,A.C,b.a a1,b.b c1 FROM tablename
a inner join tablename b on a.a= b.a and a.c=b.c
group by a.a, a.b, a.c , b.a,b.b) aa 
```

表关联查询

#### 3.去重数据

* 只保存一条航线


```mysql
SELECT * FROM ydyl_planlines_copy a WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ydyl_planlines_copy b WHERE b.start_code = a.end_code AND b.end_code = a.start_code AND a.ID > b.id) OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ydyl_planlines_copy b WHERE b.start_code = a.end_code AND b.end_code = a.start_code) GROUP BY id,start_code,end_code ORDER BY id
```

* 根据最小id去重


```mysql
DELETE from Person Where Id not in (Select Id From(Select MIN(Id) as id From Person Group by Email) t)

select * from poi_copy1 WHERE zid IN ( 
 SELECT z FROM ( SELECT MAX(zid) AS z FROM poi_copy1 GROUP BY ID ) AS ss);
```
